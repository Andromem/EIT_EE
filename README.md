EIT PCB design in Eagle CAD

This is everything required for the basic 8 electrode design to work. Photo of the assembled PCB included.

The design is based on the ADuCM350 which has a dedicated high precision front end with 16 bit resolution 160 kSPS data speed.The front end also performs a DFT at the rate of 13.8ms per calculation. This leads to a high performance minimal noise set up, excellent for both R&D or educational purposes. 

In the not too distant future kits may be available with a smaller version of the PCB mounted in a box, an electrode harness for mounting to the body, and all cables required to run. 

This combination would be an excellent educational tool for those researching this area, as it allows you to try most of the reconstruction algorithms or come up with your own and quantify any improvements in results. 

It's the same technique as is used in CATSCAN's, except the current running through the body instead of dangerous ionizing radiation of X-Rays.
